# Movie-Ranker
The program lists, in decreasing order of rating, the m highest rated movies among those that had at least k reviews

The file ratings.tsv contains one line of tab-separated values for each movie that has been rated. The first value on each line is the number of ratings that the movie received, and the second value is the average score. Scores range from 1 (worst) to 10 best. After the second tab comes the title of the movie.

The user inputs two integers, k and m. The program should then list, in decreasing order of rating, the m highest rated movies among those that had at least k reviews. After each list, it should report the time in milliseconds that it took to produce the list.
